# CSS in JS: Benefits, Drawbacks, and Tools

## Abstract

There has recently been a proliferation of libraries and utilities that attempt to fix what is apparently broken in CSS by... writing it in JavaScript. Prior to these utilities most of us did it with good old-fashioned CSS, some others in LESS, and others still in SASS, or some utility that cures the ills of writing in CSS. This talk will deep dive into the methodologies of these CSS in JS tools, the benefits of using them, as well as drawbacks, and plenty of examples of how to author your CSS in JavaScript--that is, if you leave thinking that there's validity to the practice!

## Details

The talk will start with an illustration of some of the problems of writing vanilla CSS (or even languages that compile down to CSS--e.g. SASS), particularly those centered around writing CSS in a non-trivial application or at scale. With the drawbacks of CSS first demonstrated, we'll then shift into a natural segway as to why these CSS in JS solutions were created. After all, nothing exists in a vacuum, and these tools do serve a purpose and fix some very real problems of CSS.

From this point, we'll discuss some of the various libraries that exist and solve some of these problems with "CSS in JS" solutions, and show a few quick demos of various functionality built with these libraries. More "show and tell" than live coding, although live coding can always be pretty fun, so I may still consider it.

At this point, the benefits and utility of these tools are well established. However, there are some significant drawbacks to CSS in JS (e.g. editor support, non-JS environments, etc.), and I'll illustrate these to portray a fair comparison between CSS in JS solutions and vanilla CSS.

Finally, the talk will finish with a brief summation of what we've discussed, and some brief takeaways and my own personal experiences with using CSS in JS libraries vs. pure CSS solutions.

## Pitch

CSS in JS is an especially hot topic recently, and is becoming hotter with the introduction of libraries like styled-components, glamorous, etc. in the React ecosystem, among others. It seems evident that this topic will continue to experience rapid growth due to what is perceived as the drawbacks of CSS, primarily at scale. With that said, I am quailified to speak on this *particular* topic due to my progression and use of the vast gamut of tools that CSS has offered throughout the years. Throughout my career as a frontend web developer, I've started by writing vanilla CSS, then morphed into LESS, then segwayed into SASS/Compass, used tools like CSS Modules, and then finally found myself writing _tons_ of CSS in Javascript. I will draw upon this experience to deliver what I truly believe to be an engaging, interesting, and most of all informative talk to all the great attendees of this conference.
