title: "Opening the Door to Open Source"
---

Each of us likely use some aspect of open source code, but relatively few ever make the leap into contributing back to these tools and frameworks that so vastly improve our development efforts. Why is this? What are the barriers to entry and how we can reduce and tear down any obstacles into contributing back? Once we tear down these misconceptions or obstacles, how do we actually get started with contributing back?

## Why do people not contribute back to open source

As noted, the amount of people who actually contribute to open source versus the amount of people actually using open source is so helplessly, pitifully small. I’ll go into the reasons and misconceptions of why people are oftentimes wary of dipping their toes into the open source pool, and offer approaches and ideas as to how these barriers can be alleviated.

## How do I start contributing back

Once the barriers of entry into open source are lessened or removed, the next step is to start contributing back to open source. I’ll introduce some great starter projects and issues, as well as touching upon various aspects of the contributing model (e.g. styleguide, beginner friendly issues, etc.) that can be stumbling blocks for beginners.

## OK, OK. You’re a professional now–what now?

Once the barriers of open source are removed, and once we realize how easy it really is to contribute back, why not create something yourself? I’ll go over some useful tools and utilities, as well as “best practices,” for starting with one’s own open source project. We’ll do a deep dive on authoring with Rollup, utilizing code style tools such as Prettier, and ultimately authoring a utility that can reach the greatest audience the most effectively.
