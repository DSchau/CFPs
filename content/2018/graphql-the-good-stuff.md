## Abstract

GraphQL has taken the web by storm, with some calling it a "REST killer." What can we make of this? What value is provided by migrating or developing a new or existing service to GraphQL? What are the pitfalls, pain points, or areas where migrating might not make sense? This talk intends to provide answers to each of these questions while also serving as a gentle introduction to what GraphQL does and how you can begin using it today.
