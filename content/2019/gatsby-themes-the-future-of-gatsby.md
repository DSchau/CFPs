excerpt: '2018 is the year of Gatsby. 2019 shows no signs of that changing. Where do we go from here? In this talk, I chart the path for how Gatsby plans to grow adoption and improve user experience even further in 2019, particularly with a feature we think is a game-changer: themes.'

## Abstract

Themes ease learning curves and reduce the time to a deployable app. Want to get that great blog written, but don't want to spend the time creating a bunch of components and UI details? Themes. Themes allow you to focus on what matters: delivering compelling experiences for your end users. Themes are coming very soon to Gatsby, and this talk will do a deep dive on what they are, how to use them, and the types of amazing content you can create easily with a framework that people love: Gatsby.

## Details

Gatsby is currently in a place very much like the React ecosystem _prior_ to the introduction of create-react-app. The process of getting started with a Gatsby application is often cloning (or using `gatsby new your-app <some-git-repo>`) an existing starter or boilerplate. This is _fine_ but we can do better, and we can do better with themes.

Themes in Gatsby are dual purpose: they define a data layer and they can also define the UI layer utilizing a stack people love: React and components. In other words, a blogging application may consume at least two themes: `gatsby-theme-blog-base` which will define the data structure, and `gatsby-theme-blog-some-theme-name` which will provide the UI components to provide a nicely styled, lightning-fast UI for your blogging application with minimal effort on the developer's behalf.

The overall agenda will be:

- Introduction to Gatsby
- React before create-react-app
- Gatsby before themes
- What is a theme?
- How to implement a theme?
- Demos, links, and more

## Intended Audience

Anyone interested in React, modern development practices, and making their lives easier--which I hope is everyone!

The talk will also include a gentle introduction to what Gatsby does and the value Gatsby provides before diving deep into themes.
