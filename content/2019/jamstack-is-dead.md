excerpt: "You've certainly heard the term 'JAMStack'. You may have a vague understanding of its meaning. In this talk, I'll set the record straight on the true value of the JAMStack and shift into a post-JAMStack world: the modern web."

The colloquial term "JAMStack" has come to mean different things for different people at different points in time. In defining the initialism/concept, we gain zero clarity as the term itself is so loose it can be used to describe the entire modern content web. **J**vaScript, **A**PIs, and **M**arkup -- well yeah, of course. How else do you think the web is powered?

In this talk, I'll attempt to bring some clarification into what the JAMStack actually is by diving deep technically into a representative, modern-web application that signals some of the values that the JAMStack purports to deliver. In doing so, the benefits of the so-called JAMStack become clear. You'll leave empowered to take some of these ideas to build your next, great modern web application regardless of whether JAMStack is or isn't your jam.
